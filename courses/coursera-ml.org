** Introduction

*** What is Machine Learning?

    "A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect
    to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance
    on T as measured by P, improves with experience E." Tom Mitchell
    
    In general, any machine learning can be assigned to one of two
    broad classifications: supervised learning and unsupervised
    learning. But other types include reinforcement learning and
    recommender learning.

*** Supervised Learning

    The algorithm in *supervised learning* receives a dataset where the
    "right answers" for each example is included. We know what the
    correct output should look like, having the idea that there is a
    relationship between the input and the output.
    
    Supervised learning problems are classified into *regression* and
    *classification* problems. In a regression problem we try and find
    a continuous valued output. We map input variables to some
    continuous function. In contrast, a classification problem produces
    discrete valued output. We are trying to map input variables into
    discrete categories. TODO: *Features*

*** Unsupervised Learning

    Unsupervised learning tries to find structure in a dataset where we
    have no idea what the results should look like. Clustering is an
    example of unsupervised learning. The "Cocktail Party Algorithm" is
    another; it allows you to find structure in a chaotic
    environment. (i.e. identifying individual voices and music from a
    mesh of sounds at a cocktail party).

** Linear Regression with One Variable

*** Model Representation

    In this course, we'll use $x^{(i)}$ to denote the "input" variables
    or *features* and $y^{(i)}$ to denote the "output" or *target*
    variable. A pair $(x^{(i)}, y^{(i)})$ is called a *training
    example*, and the dataset that we'll be using to learn - a list of
    m training examples $(x^{(i)}, y^{(i)}); i = 1,...,m$ - is called a
    *training set*. We will also use $X$ to denote the space of input
    values, and $Y$ to denote the space of output values. In this
    example, $X = Y = ℝ$.
    
    To describe the supervised learning problem slightly more formally,
    our goal is, given a training set, to learn a function h: X -> Y so
    that h(x) is a "good" predictor for the corresponding value of
    y. For historical reasons, this function h is called a
    *hypothesis*.

*** Cost Function

    For linear regression of one variable, we use the hypothesis
    function $h_\theta(x_i) = \theta_0 + \theta_1 x^{(i)}$. We can
    measure the accuracy of our hypothesis function by using a *cost
    function*. This (effectively) takes an average difference of all
    the results of the hypothesis with inputs from x's and the actual
    output y's.
    
    \begin{equation}
    J(\theta_0, \theta_1) = \frac{1}{2m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} (h_\theta(x_i) - y_i)^2
    \end{equation}
    
    This particular function $J(\theta_0, \theta_1)$ is called the
    "square error function", or "mean squared error." Our goal is to
    
    \begin{equation}
    \underset{\theta_0, \theta_1}{\text{minimize}}\quad J(\theta_0, \theta_1)
    \end{equation}
    
    i.e. to choose the value of $\theta_0$ and $]\theta_1$ that
    minimizes $J(\theta_0, \theta_1)$. If we try to think of it in
    visual terms, our training data set is scattered on the x-y
    plane. We are trying to make a the best possible straight line
    which passes through these scattered data points.
    
    Three-dimensional plots can be visualized with contour
    plots. Imagine these as if the color shows the height of the
    third-dimension.

*** Parameter Learning - Gradient Descent

    Gradient descent allows one to estimate the parameters in a
    hypothesis function. It's an algorithm that allows one to find

    \begin{equation}
    \underset{\theta_0, \theta_1}{\text{min}}\quad J(\theta_0, \theta_1)
    \end{equation}

    In addition to the hypothesis function of linear regression with
    one variable, gradient descent also applies to functions with more
    than two features.

    Repeat until convergence:

    \begin{equation}
    \theta_j := \theta_j - \alpha \frac{\partial}{\partial\theta_j} J(\theta_0, \theta_1)
    \end{equation}

    The $:=$ operation is assignment. $j=0,1$ represents the feature
    index number. This means that we simultaneously apply the
    assignment to each parameter. $\alpha$ is the learning rate and it
    controls how big of a step we take. We take the partial derivative
    of our cost function gives us the direction to move toward.

    Note that different starting points may end up with different
    results.

    At the local minimum the slop (and thus the derivative) becomes
    zero. As a result, the assignment doesn't change the parameter and
    gradient descent converges. As we approach a local minimum,
    gradient descent will automatically take smaller steps. So no need
    to decrease $\alpha$ over time.

    $\alpha$ must be chosen carefully. If $\alpha$ is too small,
    gradient descent can be slow. If $\alpha$ is too large, gradient
    descent can overshoot the minimum. It may fail to converge, or
    even diverge.

**** Gradient Descent for Linear Regression

     We can plug the cost function we used for linear regression into
     the gradient descent algorithm.

     Repeat until convergence:

     \begin{equation}
     \theta_j := \theta_j - \alpha \frac{\partial}{\partial\theta_j} \frac{1}{2m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} (h_\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})^2
     \end{equation}

     When we take the derivative of the cost function we get:

     \begin{equation}
     \theta_0 := \theta_0 - \alpha \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} (h_\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})
     \end{equation}
     
     \begin{equation}
     \theta_1 := \theta_1 - \alpha \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} ((h_\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})x_i)
     \end{equation}

     Since this method looks at every example in the entire training
     set on every step it is called *batch gradient descent*.

** Linear Algebra Review

   A *matrix* is a rectangular array of numbers written between square
   brackets. The *dimension of a matrix*: number of rows x number of
   columns. For example, this is a 2 x 3 matrix:

   \begin{equation}
   A =
   \begin{bmatrix}
   1 & 2 & 3 \\
   4 & 5 & 6
   \end{bmatrix}
   \end{equation}

   Also sometimes written as $ℝ^{2x3}$. Matrix elements (entries of
   matrix) are referred to as $A_{ij}$.

   A *vector* is a matrix that has only one column ($n x 1$). For
   example, this is a 4 dimensional vector ($ℝ^4)$

   \begin{equation}
   y =
   \begin{bmatrix}
   1 \\
   2 \\
   3 \\
   4
   \end{bmatrix}
   \end{equation}

   Where $y_i$ is the ith element. Note that vectors are sometimes
   1=indexed and sometimes 0-indexed. We'll generally use 1-indexed
   vectors are they are more common in math.

   Note that people usually use capital letters to refer to matrices
   and lower case letters to refer to vectors or scalars.

*** Matrix Addition

    Done *element-wise*.

    \begin{equation}
    \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 0 \\
    2 & 5 \\
    3 & 1 \\
    \end{bmatrix}
    +
    \begin{bmatrix}
    4 & 0.5 \\
    2 & 5 \\
    0 & 1 \\
    \end{bmatrix}
    =
    \begin{bmatrix}
    5 & 0.5 \\
    4 & 10 \\
    3 & 2 \\
    \end{bmatrix}
    \end{equation}

    Note that you may only add matrices of the same dimension.

*** Matrix Scalar Multiplication

    \begin{equation}
    3 \times
    \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 0 \\
    2 & 5 \\
    3 & 1 \\
    \end{bmatrix}
    =
    \begin{bmatrix}
    3 & 0 \\
    6 & 15 \\
    9 & 3 \\
    \end{bmatrix}
    \end{equation}

    The resulting matrix is of the same dimension.

*** Matrix Vector Multiplication

    \begin{equation}
    A \times x = y
    \end{equation}
    
    Where A is an *m x n matrix*, x is a *n x 1 matrix*, and y will be
    a m-dimensional vector. To get $y_i$, multiply $A$'s $i^{th}$ row
    with elements of vector $x$, and add them up.

    Here's an example:

    \begin{equation}
    \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 3 \\
    4 & 0 \\
    0 & 1 \\
    \end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix}
    1 \\
    5 \\
    \end{bmatrix}
    = 
    \begin{bmatrix}
    1\times1 + 3\times5  \\
    4\times1 + 0\times5  \\
    2\times1 + 1\times5  \\
    \end{bmatrix}
    =
    \begin{bmatrix}
    16 \\
    4 \\
    7 \\
    \end{bmatrix}
    \end{equation}

    This operation may be used to calculate the results of a
    hypothesis function in linear regression. For example, let's
    suppose we have the house sizes 2104, 1416, 1534, and 852 and our
    hypothesis function is $h_\theta(x) = -40+0.25x$. We can calculate
    the values of the hypothesis function as follows:

    \begin{equation}
    \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 2104 \\
    1 & 1416 \\
    1 & 1534 \\
    1 & 852 \\
    \end{bmatrix}
    \times
    \begin{bmatrix}
    -40 \\
    0.25 \\
    \end{bmatrix}
    =
    \begin{bmatrix}
    -40 \times 1 + 0.25 \times 2104 \\
    \dots \\
    \dots \\
    \dots \\
    \end{bmatrix}
    \end{equation}

*** Matrix Matrix Multiplication

    $A \times B = C$. The $i^{th}$ column of the matrix $C$ is
    obtained by multiplying the $i^{th}% column of $B$. Note that the
    number of columns in the first matrix must match the number of
    rows in the second matrix.

    \begin{equation}
    \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 3 \\
    2 & 5 \\
    \end{bmatrix}
    \times
    \begin{bmatrix}
    0 & 1 \\
    3 & 2 \\
    \end{bmatrix}
    =
    \begin{bmatrix}
    0 \times 1 + 3 \times 3 & 1 \times 1 + 3 \times 2 \\
    0 \times 2 + 3 \times 5 & 1 \times 2 + 5 \times 2 \\
    \end{bmatrix}
    =
    \begin{bmatrix}
    9 & 7 \\
    15 & 12 \\
    \end{bmatrix}
    \end{equation}

    We can calculate multiple hypothesis functions for a dataset using
    matrix multiplication.

*** Matrix Multiplication Properties

    Let $A$ and $B$ be matrices. Then in general $A \times B ≠ B
    \times A$ (*matrix multiplication is not commutative*). $A \times
    B \times C$ can be calculated $A \times (B \times C)$ or $(A
    \times B) \times C$. So it *matrix multiplication is associative*.

    1 is the identity of multiplication: $1 \times 7 = 7 \times 1 =
    7$. The *identity matrix* has ones along the diagonal and zero
    everywhere else. For example,

    \begin{equation}
    \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 1 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 1 \\
    \end{bmatrix}
    \end{equation}

    For any matrix $A$, $A \cdot I = I \cdot A = A$.
    
*** Inverse

    The inverse of a scalar is the value such that a multiplication
    will product one. For example $3 \times (3^{-1}) = 1$. If A is an
    m x m matrix, and if it has an inverse, $AA^{-1} = A^{-1}A = I$
    where $I$ is the identity matrix. Only square matrices have
    inverses. The inverse can be calculated with a computer. An
    example of a square matrix that doesn't have an inverse is a
    matrix will all zeros. Matrices that don't have an inverse are
    called "singular" or "degenerate".

*** Transpose

    The transposition of a matrix is like rotating the matrix 90° in
    clockwise direction and then reversing it. Let $A$ be an m x n
    matrix, and let $B = A^T$. Then $B# is an n x m matrix, and
    $B_{ij} = A_{ji}$. Here's an example:

    \begin{equation}
    A = 
    \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 2 & 0 \\
    3 & 5 & 9 \\
    \end{bmatrix}
    \end{equation}
    
    \begin{equation}
    A^T = 
    \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 3 \\
    2 & 5 \\
    0 & 9 \\
    \end{bmatrix}
    \end{equation}

** Multivariate Linear Regression

   Linear regression with multiple variables or features is also known
   as *multivariate linear regression*.

   Notation: $n$ = number of features. $m$ = number of training
   examples. $x^{(i)}$ = input (features) of $i^{th}$ training
   example. This is a vector. $x_j^{(i)}$ = value of feature $j$ in
   $i^{th}$ training example.

   Previously, our hypothesis was $h_\theta(x) = \theta_0 +
   \theta_1x$. Now, with multiple variables or features we have
   $h_\theta(x) = \theta_0 + \theta_1x_1 + \theta_2x_2 + ... +
   \theta_nx_n$.

   For convenience of notation, define $x_0 = 1$. This makes our
   feature vector zero-indexed:

   \begin{equation}
   x^{(i)} = 
   \begin{bmatrix}
   x_0 \\
   x_1 \\
   x_2 \\
   \dots \\
   x_n \\
   \end{bmatrix}
   \in ℝ^{n+1}
   \end{equation}

   \begin{equation}
   \theta = 
   \begin{bmatrix}
   \theta_0 \\
   \theta_1 \\
   \theta_2 \\
   \dots \\
   \theta_n \\
   \end{bmatrix}
   \in ℝ^{n+1}
   \end{equation}

   Using these vectors we can write our hypothesis as:

   \begin{equation}
   h_\theta(x) = \theta^Tx
   \end{equation}

*** Gradient Descent for Multiple Features

    Our cost function is (notice the slight change in the parameter):
    
    \begin{equation}
    J(\theta) = \frac{1}{2m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} (h_\theta(x_i) - y_i) ^ 2
    \end{equation}

    Repeat (with simultaneous update):

    \begin{equation}
    \theta_j := \theta_j - \alpha \frac{\partial}{\partial\theta_j} J(\theta)
    \end{equation}

    And solving the partial derivative:

    \begin{equation}
    \theta_j := \theta_j - \alpha \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} (h_\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})x^{(i)}_j
    \end{equation}
    
*** Feature Scaling

    We can speed up gradient descent by having each of our input
    values in roughly the same range. This is because $\theta$ will
    descend quickly on small ranges and slowly on large ranges, and so
    will oscillate inefficiently down to the optimum when the
    variables are very uneven.

    The way to prevent this is to modify the ranges of our input
    variables so that they are all roughly the same. Ideally $-1 \leq
    x_x \leq 1$ or $-0.5 \leq x_{(i)} \leq 0.5$.

    *Feature scaling* involves dividing the input values by the range
    (max - min) of the input variable, resulting in a new range of
    just 1. *Mean normalization* involves subtracting the average
    value for an input variable from the values for that input
    variable resulting in a new average value for the input variable
    of just zero. To implement both of these techniques, adjust your
    input values as shown in this formula:

    \begin{equation}
    x_i := \frac{x_i − μ_i}{s_i}
    \end{equation}

    Where $μ_i$ is the average of all the values for feature (i) and
    $s_i$ is the range of values (max - min) or the standard
    deviation.

*** Learning Rate

    To make sure gradient descent is working correctly, try graphing
    $J(\theta)$. This value should decrease after every iteration. The
    amount of iterations before conversion can vary a lot. To
    determine convergence, either look at this graph or declare an
    automatic convergence test (e.g. "convergence if $J(\theta)$
    decreases by less than $10^{-3}$ in one iteration. If gradient
    descent isn't working correctly, try using a smaller
    $\alpha$. Initially, try a range of values like $0.001$, $0.003$,
    $0.01$, $0.03$, $0.1$, $0.3$, and $1$ (that's going 3x each
    step).

*** Features and Polynomial Regression

    We can improve our features and form of our hypothesis function in
    a couple of different way.

    We can *combine* multiple features into one. For example, say we
    have house depth and length. We could combine this into area.

    We can *change the behavior or curve* of our hypothesis function
    by making it a quadratic, cubic, or square root function (or any
    other form) instead of linear.
    
** Computing Parameters Analytically

*** Normal Equation

    Gradient descent gives one way of minimizing J (and thus finding
    $\theta$). Let's discuss a second way of doing so, this time
    performing the minization explicitly and without resorting to an
    iterative algorithm. In the *normal equation* method, we will
    minimize J by explicitly taking its derivatives with respsec to
    the $\theta_j$s, and setting them to zero. This allows us to find
    the optimum theta without iteration. The normal equation formula
    is

    \begin{equation}
    \theta = (X^T X)^{-1} X^T y
    \end{equation}

    Where each row of X is a training example and y is a vector of all
    outputs in the training examples.

    There is no need to do feature scaling with the normal equation.

    | Gradient Descent           | Normal Equation                             |
    |----------------------------+---------------------------------------------|
    | Need to choose alpha       | No need to choose alpha                     |
    | Needs many iterations      | No need to iterate                          |
    | $O(kn^2)$                  | O(n^3), need to calculate inverse of $X^TX$ |
    | Works well when n is large | Slow if n is very large                     |
    
    In practice, when n exceeds 10,000 it might be a good time to go
    from a normal solution to an iterative process.

    If $X_TX$ is noninvertable, the common causes might be having
    redundant features or too many features (e.g. $m \leq n$).

* Week 3

** Logistic Regression

*** Classification

    A spam filter is an example of a classification problem. We have
    two classes: 0 (not spam) and 1 (spam). $y \in \{0, 1\}$. 0 is the
    *negative class*, 1 is the *positive class*.

    Linear regression can be used for classification. We can map all
    predictions greater than 0.5 as a 1 and all less than 0.5 as
    a 0. Often, though, classification isn't actually a linear
    function. In addition, produced y values can be smaller than 0 and
    greater than 1. This sometimes makes linear regression unfit for
    classification.

*** Representation

    Our hypothesis function for linear regression was $h_\theta(x) =
    \theta^Tx$. For logistic regression, we'll wrap this function in g
    that guarantees $0 \leq h_\theta \leq 1$. This g is called the
    *sigmoid function* or the *logistic function* (which gives rise to
    the name of the model).

    \begin{equation}
    h_\theta(x) = g(\theta^Tx)
    \end{equation}

    \begin{equation}
    z = \theta^Tx
    \end{equation}

    \begin{equation}
    g(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}
    \end{equation}

    $h_\theta(x)$ will give us the *probability* that our output is 1
    or $P(y = 1|x; \theta)$.

*** Decision Boundary

    In order to get our discrete 0 or 1 classification, we can
    translate the output of the hypothesis function as follows:
    
    \begin{equation}
    h_\theta(x) \geq 0.5 \rightarrow y = 1
    \end{equation}

    \begin{equation}
    h_\theta(x) < 0.5 \rightarrow y = 0
    \end{equation}

    Now remember that our hypothesis function now wraps the logistic
    function g around $\theta^Tx$. The logistic function's output is
    $\geq 0.5$ when its input is $\geq 0$. This means that when:

    \begin{equation}
    \theta^Tx \geq 0 \rightarrow y = 1
    \end{equation}
    
    \begin{equation}
    \theta^Tx < 0 \rightarrow y = 0
    \end{equation}
    
    The *decision boundary* is the line that separates the area where
    y = 0 and where y = 1. It is created by our hypothesis function.

*** Cost Function

    For linear regression, we used the cost function $J(\theta) =
    \frac{1}{2m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} \frac{1}{2}(h_\theta(x_i) -
    y_i)^2$. Now we could use this cost function for logistic
    regression, but unfortunately with our new hypothesis function,
    we'll have a wavy, *non-convex* cost function. This means that
    there will be lots of local minima.

    Instead, for logistic regression, we'll use the cost function:

    \begin{equation}
    J(\theta) = \frac{1}{2m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} Cost(h_\theta(x), y)
    \end{equation}
    
    \begin{equation}
    Cost(h_\theta(x), y) = 
    \begin{cases}
    -log(h_\theta(x)) &\quad\text{if}\ y=0 \\
    -log(1 - h_\theta(x)) &\quad\text{if}\ y=1
    \end{cases}
    \end{equation}

    This gives us a *convex* cost function (single minima). Here are
    some properties:

    \begin{equation}
    Cost(h_\theta(x), y) = 0\ \text{if}\ h_\theta(x) = y
    \end{equation}

    \begin{equation}
    Cost(h_\theta(x), y) \rightarrow \infty\ \text{if}\ y = 0\ \text{and}\ h_\theta(x) \rightarrow 1
    \end{equation}

    \begin{equation}
    Cost(h_\theta(x), y) \rightarrow \infty\ \text{if}\ y = 1\ \text{and}\ h_\theta(x) \rightarrow 0
    \end{equation}

    We can compress our cost function's two conditional cases into
    one case:

    \begin{equation}
    Cost(h_\theta(x), y) = -y \log(h_\theta(x)) - (1 - y) \log(1 - h_\theta(x))
    \end{equation}

    A vectorized implementation is:

    \begin{equation}
    h = g(X\theta)
    \end{equation}

    \begin{equation}
    J(\theta) = \frac{1}{m} \cdot (-y^T\log(h) - (1 - y)^T\log(1 - h))
    \end{equation}

*** Gradient Descent

    Remember that the general form of gradient descent is to repeat {
    $\theta_j := \theta_j -
    \alpha\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta_j}J(\theta)$ }.

    We can work out the derivative part using calculus to get repeat {
    $\theta_j := \theta_j - \alpha \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m}
    (h_\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})x^{(i)}_j$ }.

    Notice that this algorithm is identical to the one we used in
    linear regression. We still have to simultaneously update all
    values in theta.

    A vectorized implementation is $\theta := \theta -
    \frac{\alpha}{m} X^T(g(X\theta)-\overrightarrow{y})$.

*** Advanced Optimization

    *Conjugate gradient*, *BFGS*, and *L-BFGS* are more sophisticated,
    faster ways to optimize θ that can be used instead of gradient
    descent. It's suggested that you should not write these more
    sophisticated algorithms yourself (unless you are an expert in
    numerical computing) but use the libraries instead, as they're
    already tested and highly optimized. Octave provides the *fminunc*
    for this purpose.

** Multiclass Classification

   Let's say you want to classify weather as sunny, cloudy, rain, or
   snow, this would be a multiclass classification problem. We can use
   a binary classification algorithm (like logistic regression) as a
   multiclass classification algorithm using *one-for-all*. Here we
   train a logistic regression classifier for /each/ class to predict
   the probability, lumping all the others into a single second
   class. To make a prediction on a new x, pick the class that
   maximizes $h_\theta(x)$.

** Overfitting

   Consider the problem of predicting y from $x \in R$. The leftmost
   figure below shows the result of fitting a $y = \theta_x +
   \theta_1x$ to a dataset. We see that the data doesn't really lie on
   a straight line, and so the fit is not very good (*underfit*).
   
   [[~/org/images/overfitting.png]]

   Instead, if we had added an extra feature $x^2$, and fit $y =
   \theta_0 + \theta_1x + \theta_2x^2$, then we obtain a slightly
   better fit to the data (see middle figure). Naively, it might seem
   that the more features we add, the better. However, there is also a
   danger in adding too many features: the rightmost figure is the
   result of fitting a 5th order polynomial. We see that even though
   the fitted curve passes through the data perfectly, we would not
   expect this to be a very good predictor of, say, housing prices (y)
   for different living areas (x). The left figure shows an instance
   of *underfitting* — in which the data clearly shows structure not
   captured by the model — and the figure on the right is an example
   of *overfitting*.

   Underfitting, or high bias, is when the form of our hypothesis
   function h maps poorly to the tend of the data. It is usually
   caused by a function that is too simple or uses too few
   features. At the other extreme, overfitting, or high variance, is
   caused by a hypothesis function that fits the available data but
   does not generalize well to predict new data. It is usually caused
   by a complicated function that creates a lot of unnecessary curves
   and angles unrelated to the data. This terminology is applied to
   both linear and logistic regression.

   There are two main options to address the issue of overfitting:

   1. Reduce the number of features:
      - Manually select which features to keep
      - Use a model selection algorithm (studied later in the course)
   2. Regularization
      - Keep all the features, but reduce the magnitude of parameters
        $\theta_j$.
      - Regulaization works well when we have a lot of slightly useful
        features.

*** Cost Function

    If we have overfitting from our hypothesis function, we can educe
    the weight that some of the terms in our function carry by
    increasing their cost.

    Say we wanted to make the following function more quadratic:

    \begin{equation}
    \theta_0 + \theta_1x + \theta_2x^2 + \theta_3x^3 + \theta_4x^4
    \end{equation}

    We'll want to eliminate the influence of $\theta_3x^3$ and
    $\theta_4x^4$. Without actually getting rid of these features or
    changing the form of our hypothesis, we can instead modify our
    cost function: 

    \begin{equation}
    min_\theta \frac{1}{2m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} (h_\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})^2 + 1000 \cdot \theta^2_3 + 100 \cdot \theta^2_4
    \end{equation}
    
    We've added two extra terms at the end to inflate the cost of
    $\theta_3$ and $\theta_4$. Now, in order for the cost function to
    get close to zero, we will have to reduce the values of $\theta_3$
    and $\theta_4$ to near zero. This will in turn greatly reduce the
    values of $\theta_3x^3$ and $\theta_4x^4$ in our hypothesis
    function.

    We could also regularize all of our theta parameters in a single
    summation as:

    \begin{equation}
    min_\theta \frac{1}{2m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} (h_\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})^2 + \lambda \sum_{j=1}^{n} \theta^2_j
    \end{equation}

    The $\lambda$ is the *regulaization parameter*. It determines how
    much the costs of our theta parametes are inflated.

    Using the above cost function with the extra summation, we can
    smooth the output of our hypothesis function to reduce
    overfitting. If lambda is chosen to be too large, it may smooth
    out the function too much and cause underfitting.

    gradient descent and the normal equation.
