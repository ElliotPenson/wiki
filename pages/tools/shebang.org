#+TITLE: Shebang

* Description

  A /shebang/ or /hashbang/ is a particular line that often begins
  scripts. The line begins with the characters ~#!~. This line defines
  which program should be passed the contents of the file. For
  example:

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    #!/bin/sh
    echo "Hi there!"
  #+END_SRC

* /usr/bin/env

  The paths in the shebang line may be different of different
  machines. The ~env~ program exists to solve this problem and make
  scripts portable. This program looks in the user's ~$PATH~ to find
  the location of an application. The path ~/user/bin/env~ is commonly
  used for this utility.
  
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    #!/usr/bin/env sh
    echo "Hi there!"
  #+END_SRC

* Script Execution

  Once a shebang line exists, the ~chmod~ command can be used to make
  a script executable.
  
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    chmod +x script.sh
    ./script.sh
  #+END_SRC

  The first line adds (~+~) the executable (~x~) permission to the
  file.
