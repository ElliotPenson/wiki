#+TITLE: Fractals
#+AUTHOR: Elliot Penson

The French-American polymath, Benoit Mandelbrot, is often referred to as 'the
Father of Fractals'. Mandelbrot introduced the word /fractal/ in 1975 and
highlighted the need for fractal mathematics. Information on this page is taken
from /Fractals/ by Kenneth Falconer.

* Definition

  Something is regarded as a fractal if all or most of the following properties
  hold in some form.

  - *Fine structure*
    - Irregularities at arbitrarily small scales. This is very
      different from, say, a circle where a small portion of the perimeter
      sufficiently magnified will appear almost indistinguishable from a
      straight line.
  - *Self-similarity*
    - Made up of smaller scale copies of itself. See the section on
      [[Self-Similarity and Templates][self-similarity]] below.
  - *Classical mathematics are not applicable*
    - Traditional Euclidean geometric language doesn't easily describe
      fractals. Fractals often have infinite length and zero area.
  - *Recursive definition*
    - Many fractals are constructed by performing a simple step over and over
      again.

  The definition of a fractal is somewhat analogous to the way biologists define
  'life'. Something is held to be alive if it has all or most of the
  characteristics on a list: ability to grow, ability to reproduce, ability to
  respond to stimuli in some way, etc.

* Example: Von Koch Curve

  Take a straight line ($E_0$) and divide it into three equal pieces. Erase the
  middle piece, and replace this by the other two sides of an equilateral
  triangle on the same base ($E_1$). Repeat with each of these four pieces
  ($E_2$).

  Repeated indefinitely, this procedure becomes the *von Koch curve* ($F$).

  This fractal was introduced and studied by the Swedish mathematician Helge
  von Koch in 1906. This fractal displays fine structure as a consequence of
  being self-similar: the curve consists of four parts, each a 1/3 scale copy
  of the entire curve.

  If we take three copies of the von Koch curve and join them corner to corner
  in a triangle, we get the *von Koch snowflake*.

* Iteration

  Fractals are often drawn on a plane with a collection of points. This
  collection of points is referred to as a *set*. A set might be a circle, a von
  Koch curve, or the silhouette of a person.

  A set can be formed by repeatedly applying a function. Given a function
  (e.g. $(x, y) -> (x + 1, y)$) and some initial point, we discover a new
  point. Applying the function to this point gives us a third point. The process
  of repeatedly applying the function is known as *iterating* the function and
  the points visited are the *iterates* of the initial point. Iterates jump
  around and build up a curved, stratified figure called the *attractor* of the
  function.

  Repeated application of a simple operation may give rise to a complex, fractal
  form. A fractal attractor is sometimes called a *strange attractor*.

* Self-Similarity and Templates

  Two figures are *similar* if they have the same shape, but not necessarily the
  same size. Objects are *congruent* if they have the same shape and size. A
  *self-similar* set is one that is made up of several smaller similar copies of
  itself.

  The Koch curve is self-similar since it comprises 4 suitably placed scale
  $1/3$ copies of itself. This may be represented diagrammatically by a template
  consisting of one large rectangle and 4 smaller ones, each a $1/3$ copy of the
  large one.

  Put generally, a *template* consists of some simple shape (square, rectangle,
  triangle, etc.) and a number of smaller similar copies of the shape positioned
  somehow in the plane. Each of the smaller shapes represents a transformation
  that scales and repositions the larger shape. The template completely defines
  the fractal: given a template, there is essentially just one figure, usually a
  fractal, that is made up of smaller scaled copies of itself positioned as
  indicated.

  There are 8 different similarities that transform a square to a smaller
  square. The scaling can be direct or there can be a rotation through 90°,
  180°, or 270°, or a mirror reflection in a vertical, horizontal, or one of the
  two diagonal lines. We refer to these possibilities as the *orientations* of
  the scalings. The orientations of the similarity transformations must be
  specified to remove ambiguity.

  Templates are simply a diagrammatic way of expressing a family of
  transformations or functions. Each of the smaller shapes codes the similarity
  transformation which takes the large shape and scales it down to the size and
  position of the smaller one. The functions have the advantage that they also
  encode the orientations of the transformations. The *Chaos Game* is a method
  of constructing templates with functions.

  1. Take any initial starting point.
  2. Select one of the functions at random.
  3. Apply the chosen function to get the next point.
  4. Go to step 2.

  An *affine transformation* is more general than a similarity, in that it
  scales by different ratios in different directions and so elongates
  objects. For example, affine transformations transform squares into rectangles
  or parallelograms, and circles into ellipses. A *self-affine* fractal is one
  that is made up of smaller affine copies of itself.

* Example: Sierpinsky Triangle

  The *(right angled) Sierpinski triangle* is made up of 3 copies of itself at
  scale $1/2$.

  The three functions giving the three similarity transformations that transform
  the unit square to the bottom left, bottom right, and top left squares
  respectively, have the formulae:

  \begin{equation}
  (x, y) \rightarrow (\frac{1}{2}x,\frac{1}{2}y)
  \end{equation}

  \begin{equation}
  (x, y) \rightarrow (\frac{1}{2}x + \frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2}y)
  \end{equation}

  \begin{equation}
  (x, y) \rightarrow (\frac{1}{2}x,\frac{1}{2}y + \frac{1}{2})
  \end{equation}

  The traditional Sierpinski triangle is constructed with equilateral triangles.
