The normal (or Gaussian) distribution is a common probability distribution.

* Equation

  The distribution's probability density function is

  \begin{equation}
  f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{\frac{-(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}
  \end{equation}

  This equation has two parameters: $\mu$ and $\sigma$. $\mu$ is the mean of the
  distribution. $\sigma$ is the standard deviation. The normal distribution is
  often just represented by these two parameters.

* Properties

  - Bell-shaped curve.
  - Total area under the curve is 1.
  - Symmetrical

* Standard Normal Distribution

  The standard normal distribution is simply when $\mu$ = 0, $\sigma$ = 0.
