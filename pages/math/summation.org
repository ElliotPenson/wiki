#+TITLE: Summation

A summation is a concise expression describing the addition of an arbitrarily
large set of numbers. A capital sigma is denotes summation.

\begin{equation}
\sum_{i=1}^{n} f(i) = f(1) + f(2) + ... + f(n)
\end{equation}

Here, $m$ is the *lower bound* and $n$ is the *upper bound*. The summation
starts at $m$ and ends at $n$. $i$ is the *index of summation*.

* Examples

  Simple closed forms exist for many algebraic functions.

  \begin{equation}
  \sum_{i=1}^{n} c = nc
  \end{equation}

  \begin{equation}
  \sum_{i=1}^{n} 1 = n
  \end{equation}

  \begin{equation}
  \sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
  \end{equation}

  \begin{equation}
  \sum_{i=1}^{3} i^2 = 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 = 14
  \end{equation}

* Product

  A similar notation is used to convey iterative multiplication.

  \begin{equation}
  \prod_{i=a}^{b} f(i)
  \end{equation}
