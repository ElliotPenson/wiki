AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) is a managed service for creating and
controling encryption keys. AWS KMS is integrated with other AWS services
including EBS, S3, Redshift, Elastic Transcoder, WorkMail, RDS, and others. KMS
can be found under IAM in the AWS console.

Encryption keys with KMS /are/ regional.

As a best practice, the user with key administrative permissions should be
different than the user with key usage permissions.

* Envelope Encryption

  Envelope encryption provides an extra layer of encryption. A customer master
  key is used to encrypt the envelope key (data key). The envelope key is used
  to decrypt the data.
