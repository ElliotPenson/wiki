AWS X-Ray is a distributed tracing system that allows visualization of
serverless applications. X-Ray collects data about requests that your
application serves and provides tools you can use to view, filter, and gain
insights into that data to identify issues and opportunities for optimization.

X-Ray provides an SDK that gives
- Interceptors to add to your code to trace incoming HTTP requests.
- Client handlers to instrument AWS SDK clients that your application uses to
  call other AWS services.
- An HTTP client to instrument calls to other internal and external HTTP web
  services.

X-Ray integrates with ELB, Lambda, API Gateway, EC2, and Elastic Beanstalk.
