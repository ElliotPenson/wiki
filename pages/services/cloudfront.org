#+TITLE: Amazon CloudFront
#+AUTHOR: Elliot Penson

CloudFront is Amazon's Content Delivery Network (CDN). A CDN is a system of
distributed servers (network) that deliver web pages and other web content to a
user based on the geographic locations of the user, the origin of the web page
and a content delivery server.

Let's that we're running a web site from London without a CDN. We'll get
different latencies from different locations. This site might be fast for users
in France. Unfortunately it might be slow for users in Australia.

With CloudFront, users contact an /Edge Location/ instead. Amazon currently have
over 50 edge locations. This Edge Location will check if the object is
cached. If not, the object will be retrieved from the /Origin/ and then cached
for a certain /Time To Live/ (TTL). It's only the first user that experiences
the penalty.

Amazon CloudFront can be used to deliver your entire website, including dynamic,
static, streaming, and interactive content using a global network of edge
locations. Requests for your content are automatically routed to the nearest
edge location, so content is delivered with the best possible performance.

Amazon CloudFront is optimized to work with other Amazon Web Services, like
Amazon Simple Storage (S3), Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), Amazon Elastic
Load Balancing, and Amazon Route 53. Amazon CloudFront also works seamlessly
with any non-AWS origin server which stores the original, definitive versions of
your files.

* Terminology

  - *Edge Location*: The location where content will be cached. This is separate to
    an AWS Region/Availability Zone. Edge locations are not just READ only, you
    can write to them too (PUT).
  - *Origin*: The origin of all the files that the CDN will distribute. This can
    be either an S3 Bucket, an EC2 Instance, an Elastic Load Balancer, Route53,
    or a non-AWS server.
  - *Distribution*: The name given to the CDN which consists of a collection of
    Edge Locations. CloudFront has two delivery methods:
    - *Web Distribution*: Typically used for websites, specifically
      HTTP/HTTPS.
    - *RTMP Distribution*: Used for media streaming with the Adobe Real Time
      Messaging Protocol (flash).

* Caching and Invalidating

  Objects are cached for the life of the TTL (Time To Live, in seconds). If the
  object is changed in the origin, the changes won't be seen at the Edge
  Location until the TTL has expired.

  /Invalidating/ objects removes them from CloudFront edge caches. Clearing cached
  objects costs money so you'll want to try and avoid it. Good CloudFront design
  involves choosing an appropriate TTL for your application.

* Restrictions

  When creating a CloudFront distribution, you can choose to /Restrict Bucket
  Access/. This prevents users from accessing the bucket without using an edge
  location. If this feature is enabled you must choose an /Origin Access
  Identity/. This is the user that will then be used to access the bucket.

  /Restrict Viewer Access/ is an option that appears when creating a CloudFront
  distribution. You can choose to use signed URLs or signed cookies. This option
  allows one to make sure that only certain (e.g. paying) customers can access
  content.

  /Geo Restriction/ can be used to prevent users in selected countries from
  accessing your content. You may create a blacklist or a whitelist.
