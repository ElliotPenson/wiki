Service models define how a service or product is delivered, how you pay, what
you receive, and what you manage.

* IaaS

  IaaS stands for infrastructure as a service. Here, the system stack is split:
  the customer manages data, applications, runtimes, and the operating
  system. AWS EC2 is an example of IaaS.

* PaaS

  PaaS stands for platform as a service. In PaaS, customers give up a bit more
  control; customers only manage data and the application(s). Google App Engine
  is an example of PaaS.

* SaaS

  SaaS stands for software as a service. The vendor manages the entirety of the
  system stack (other than perhaps the data). Slack is an example of SaaS.
