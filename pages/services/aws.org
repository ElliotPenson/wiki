* 10,000 Foot Overview

  The cloud enabled quick experimentation without danger. This is the cloud's
  power.

** AWS Global Infrastructure

   A *region* is a geographical area. It's a physical location in the world
   which consists of 2 (or more) *availability zones*. An availability zone
   (*AZ*) is one or more discrete data centers, each with redundant power,
   networking and connectivity, housed in separate facilities. The availability
   zones are far enough apart that an issue in one shouldn't affect another.

   *Edge locations* are endpoints for AWS which are used for caching
   content. Typically this consists of CloudFront, Amazon's Content Delivery
   Network (CDN). There are many more edge locations than regions. Currently
   there are over 96 edge locations.

   Everything else sits on top of the AWS Global Infrastructure.
