Streaming data is data that is generated continuously by sometimes thousands of
data sources, which typically send in records simultaneously, and in small sizes
(order of Kilobytes). Amazon Kinesis is a platform on AWS to send your streaming
data to! Kinesis makes it easy to load and analyze streaming data. The service
also allows you to build custom applications for your business needs.

* Kinesis Streams

  Kinesis Streams connect information pushed by /producers/ to /consumers/ which
  process the data in real time. Kinesis Streams retain data for 24 hours by
  default. This can be extended to up to 7 days. Kinesis Streams consist of
  /shards/. A shard has a sequence of data records. The data capacity of your
  stream is a function of the number of shards that you specify for the
  stream. You manage the consumers with Kinesis Streams. These consumers will
  usually transform and save the data.

* Kinesis Firehose

  Kinesis Firehose also connects producers to consumers. You don't need to worry
  about shards though. Firehose is a very automated way of doing
  streams. There's no concept of a retention period. Firehose usually writes to
  S3 or Elasticsearch Cluster. Note that you do not implement consumers yourself
  in Firehose.

* Kinesis Analytics

  Kinesis Analytics allow you to run SQL queries on streaming data in real
  time. These queries are ran on Kinesis Streams or Kinesis Firehouse.
