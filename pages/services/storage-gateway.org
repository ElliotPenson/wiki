#+TITLE: AWS Storage Gateway
#+AUTHOR: Elliot Penson

The AWS Storage Gateway is a service connecting an on-premises software
appliance with cloud-based storage to provide seamless and secure integration
between an organization's on-premises IT environment and AWS's storage
infrastructure. The service enables you to securely store date to the AWS cloud
for scalable and cost-effective storage.

AWS Storage Gateway's software appliance is available for download as a virtual
machine (VM) image that you install on a host in your datacenter. Storage
Gateway supports either VMware ESXi or Microsoft Hyper-V. Once you've installed
your gateway and associated it with your AWS account through the activation
process, you can use the AWS Management Console to create the storage gateway
option that is right for you.

* Four Types of Storage Gateways

  - *File Gateway (NFS)*: Flat files are stored directly on S3.
  - *Volumes Gateway (iSCSI)*: Block storage. e.g. a virtual hard drive.
    - *Stored Volumes*: Store an entire copy of your data on-premises. Backed up
      as a snapshot to S3 asynchronously.
    - *Cached Volumes*: Only storing the most recently accessed on-premises.
  - *Tape Gateway (VTL)*: Used for backup and uses popular backup applications
    like NetBackup, Backup Exec, Veeam, etc.

  For the AWS Solutions Architect exam, know these four types at a high level
  and their use cases.

* File Gateway

  Files are stored as objects in your S3 buckets, accessed through a Network
  File System (NFS) mount point. Ownership, permissions, and timestamps are
  durably stored in S3 in the user-metadata of the object associated with the
  file. Once objects are transferred to S3, they can be managed as native S3
  objects, and bucket policies such as versioning, lifecycle management, and
  cross-region replication apply directly to object stored in your bucket.

* Volume Gateway

  The volume interface presents your applications with disk volumes using the
  iSCSI block protocol. You can store operating systems, applications,
  databases, etc. Think of this as a virtual hard disk.

  Data written to these volumes can be asynchronously backed up as point-in-time
  snapshots of your volumes, and stored in the cloud as Amazon EBS
  snapshots. EBS (Elastic Block Stores) are virtual hard disks that are usually
  attached to EC2 instances.

  Snapshots are incremental backups that capture only changed blocks. On changes
  from the last snapshot are stored. All snapshot store is also compressed to
  minimize your storage charges.

** Stored Volumes

   Stored volumes let you store your primary data locally, while asynchronously
   backing up that data to AWS. Stored volumes provide your on-premises
   applications with low-latency access to their entire datasets, while
   providing durable, off-site backups. You can create storage volumes and mount
   them as iSCSI devices from your on-premises application servers. Data written
   to your stored volumes is stored on your on-premises storage hardware. This
   data is asynchronously backed up to S3 in the form of Amazon Elastic Block
   Store (Amazon EBS) snapshots. 1GB - 16TB in size for Stored Volumes.

   You keep a complete copy of your data on-site.

** Cached Volumes

   Cached volumes let you use S3 as your primary data storage while retaining
   frequently accessed data locally in your storage gateway. Cached volumes
   minimize the need to scale your on-premises storage infrastructure, while
   still providing your applications with low-latency access to their frequently
   access data. You can create storage volumes up to 32TB in size and attach to
   them as iSCSI devices from your on-premises application servers. Your gateway
   stores data that you write to these volumes in Amazon S3 and retains recently
   read data in your on-premises storage gateway's cache and upload buffer
   storage. 1GB - 32TB in size for Cached Volumes.

   You /do not/ keep a complete copy of your data on-site.

* Tape Gateway

  Tape Gateway offers a durable, cost-effective solution to archive your data in
  the AWS Cloud. The VTL inferface it provides lets you leverage your existing
  tape-based backup application infrastructure to store data on virtual tape
  cartridges that you create on your tape gateway. Each tape gateway is
  preconfigured with a media charger and tape drives, which are available to
  your existing client backup applications as iSCSI devices. You add tape
  cartridges as you need to archive your data. Supported by NetBackup, Backup
  Exec, Veeam, etc.
