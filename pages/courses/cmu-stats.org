** Metacognition
   
   Metacognition, or "thinking about thinking," refers to your awareness
   of yourself as a learner and your ability to regulate your own
   learning.
   
   1. Assess the task
   2. Evaluate your strengths and weaknesses
   3. Plan an approach
   4. Apply strategies and monitor your performance
   5. Reflect and adjust if needed
      
** The Big Picture
   
   The *population* is the entire group that is the target of our
   interest. *Producing data* involves choosing a sample of the
   population and collecting data from it. Usually we choose a sample
   because the population is too large to examine as a
   whole. *Exploratory Data Analysis* consists of summarizing the
   collected data. *Probability* tells us how the sample we're using may
   differ from the population as a whole. Probability is the "machinery"
   that allows us to draw conslusions about the population based on the
   data collected about the sample. Finally, we can use what we've
   discovered about our sample to draw conslusions about the population
   based on the data collected about the sample. Finally, we can use what
   we've discovered about our sample to draw conslusions about our
   population. We call this final step in the process *inference*.

* Unit 1 - Exploratory Data Analysis
  
** Introduction
   
   *Data* are pieces of information about individuals organized into
   variables. By an *individual*, we mean a particular person or
   object. By a *variable*, we mean a particular characteristic of the
   individual.
   
   A *dataset* is a set of data identified with particular
   circumstances. Datasets are typically displayed in tables, in which
   rows represent individuals and columns represent variables.
   
   *Quantitative variables* take numerical values, and represent some
   kind of measurement. *Categorical variables* take category or
   label values, and place an individual into one of several groups.
   
   *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)* is how we make sense of the data
   by converting them from their raw form to a more informative
   one. EDA consists of:
   - Organizing and summarizing the raw data,
   - Discovering important features and patterns in the data and any
     striking deviations from those patterns, and then,
   - Interpreting our findings in the context of the problem
     
   *Distributions* are concerned with one variable at
   time. *Replationships* are concerned with two variables at a time.
   
** Module 1 - Examining Distributions
   
    By *distribution* of a variable, we mean:
   - What values the variable takes, and
   - How often the variable takes those values.
     
*** One Categorical Variable
    
    The distribution of a categorical variable is summarized using:
   - Graphical display: pie chart or bar chart, supplemented by
   - Numerical summaries: category counts and percentages.
     
   The pie chart emphasizes how the different categories relate to the
   whole, and the bar chart ephasizes how the different categories
   compare with each other.
   
*** One Quantitative Variable
    
    To display data from one quantitative variable graphically, we can
    use either the *histogram* or the *stemplot*.
    
    Breaking a range of values into intervals can be useful for
    graphing. The square brakcet means "including" and the parenthesis
    means "not including". For example, [50,60) is the interval from 50
    to 60, including 50 and not including 60.
    
**** Graphs
     
***** Histogram
      
      Once the distribution has been displayed graphically, we can
      describe the overall pattern of the distibution and mention any
      striking deviations from that pattern. More specifically, we should
      consider the following features of the distribution:
   - Overall pattern:
     - Shape
     - Center
     - Spread
   - Deviations from the pattern:
     - Outliers
       
****** Shape
       
       When describing the shape of a distribution, we should consider:
   1. Symmetry/skewness of the distribution
   2. Peakedness (modality) - the number of peaks (modes) the
      distribution has.
      
   [[../images/histogram-shapes.gif]]
   
   Clockwise from left: symmetric, single-peaked (unimodal);
   suymmetric, double-peaked (bimodal); symmetric, uniform;
   skewed-left, skewed-right.
   
   Note that if a distribution has more than two modes, we say that
   the distribution is multimodal.
   
****** Center
       
       The center of the distribution is its *midpoint* - the value that
       divides the distribution so that approximately half the observations
       take smaller values, and approximately half the observations take
       larger values.
       
****** Spread
       
       The *spread* (also called *variability*) of the distribution can be
       described by the approximate range covered by the data. From looking
       at the histogram, we can approximate the smallest observation
       (*min*), and the largest observation (*max*), and thus approximate
       the *range*.
       
****** Outliers
       
       *Outliers* are observations that fall outside the overall pattern.
       
       It is always important to interpret what the features of the
       distribution (as they appear in the histogram) mean in teh context
       of the data.
       
***** Stemplot
      
      The stemplot (also called stem and leaf plot) is another graphical
      display of the distribution of quantitative data. Separate each data
      point into a stem and leaf, as follows:
  - The leaf is the right-most digit.
  - The stem is everything except the right-most digit
  - So, if the data point is 34, then 3 is the stem and 4 is the leaf
  - If the data point is 3.41, the 3.4 is the stem and 1 is the leaf
    
  For example, with the data:
  34 34 26 37 42 41 35 31 41 33 30 74 33 49 38 61
  21 41 26 80 43 29 33 35 45 49 39 34 26 25 35 33
  
  1. Separate each observation into a stem and a leaf.
  2. Write the stems in a vertical column with the smallest at the
     top, and draw a vertical line at the right of this column.
  3. Go through the data points, and write each leaf in the row to the
     right of its stem.
  4. Rearrange the leaves in an increasing order

  When some of the stems hold a large number of leaves, we can split
  each stem into two: one holding the leaves 0-4, and the other
  holding the leaves 5-9.

  Note that when rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise, the stemplot
  visually resembles a histogram. The stemplot has additional unique
  features: it preserves the original data and sorts the data.
  
**** Numerical Measures
     
     The overall pattern of the distribution of a quantitative
     variable is described by its shape, center, and spread. By
     inspecting the histogram, we can describe the shape of the
     distribution, but as we saw, we can only get a rough estimate for
     the center and spread. A description of the distribution of a
     quantitative variable must include, in addition to the graphical
     display, a more precise numerical description of the center and
     spread of the distribution.
     
***** Measures of Center
      
      The three main numerical measure for the center of a
      distribution are the *mode*, the *mean*, and the *median*. The
      mode is the most commonly occuring value in a distribution; it's
      the "peak" of the distribution. The mean is the average of a set
      of observations. We denote this as x-bar. The median M is the
      midpoint of the distribution. If n is odd, the median is the
      center observation in the ordered list. If n is even, the median
      is the mean of the two center observations in the ordered list.

      Note that the mean is very sensitive to outliers (because it
      factors in their magnitude), while the median is resistant to
      outliers. So for symmetric distributions with no outliers, x-bar
      is approximately equal to M. For skewed right distributions
      and/or datasets with high outliers, x-bar > M. For skewed left
      distributions and/or datasets with low outliers, x-bar < M.

***** Measures of Spread

      The three most commonly used measures of spread are *range*,
      *inter-quartile range* (IQR), and *standard deviation*. The
      range is exactly the distance between the smallest data point
      (min) and the largest one (max).

****** Inter-Quartile Range (IQR)

       While the range quantifies the variability by looking at the
       range covered by /all/ the data, the IQR measures the
       variability of a distribution by giving us the range covered
       by the middle 50% of the data.

       IQR = Q3 - Q1, the difference between the third and first
       quartiles. The first quartile (Q1) is the value such that one
       quarter (25%) of the data points fall below it, or the median
       of the bottom half of the data. The third quartile is the value
       such that three quarters (75%) of the data points fall below
       it, or the median of the top half of the data.

       [[../images/IQR.gif]]

       Note that when n is odd, the median is *not* included in either
       the bottom or top half of the data; When n is even, the data
       are naturally divided into two halves.
       
       The IQR is used as the basis for a rule of thumb for
       identifying outliers. An observation is considered a suspected
       outlier if it is:
       - below Q1 - 1.5(IQR) or
       - above Q3 + 1.5(IQR)

       Depending on the cause of the outlier, one may want to include
       or remove the data point. For example, outliers produced by the
       same process that are expected to eventually occur again should
       be kept. But outliers produced under different conditions or by
       mistake should be removed or corrected.

***** Boxplot

      The *five-number summary* of a distribution consists of the
      median (M), the two quartiles (Q1, Q3), and the extremes (min,
      Max). The boxplot depicts the five number summary (blue), the
      range and IQR (red), and outliers (green).

      [[../images/boxplot.gif]]

      Boxplots are most useful when presented side-by-side for
      comparing and contrasting distributions from two or more
      groups.

***** Standard Deviation

      Another measure of spread, the *standard deviation* (SD),
      quantities the spread of a distribution in a completely
      different way. The idea behind the standard deviation is to
      quantify the spread of a distribution by measuring how far the
      observations are from their mean, x-bar. The standard deviation
      gives the average (or typical distance) between a data point and
      the mean.

      [[../images/standard-deviation.gif]]

      Note that the average of the square deviations (the part weithin
      the square root) is called the *variance* of the data. So the SD
      of the data is the square root of the variance.

      So while the IQR should be paired as a measure of spread with
      the median as a measure of center, the SD should be paired as a
      measure of spread with the mean as a measure of center.
      
      Like the mean, the SD is strongly influenced by outliers in the
      data. Use x-bar (the mean) and the standard deviation as
      measures of center and spread /only/ for reasonably symmetric
      distributions with no outliers. Use the five-number summary
      (which gives the median, IQR, and range) for all other cases.

      For symmetric mound-shaped distributions, the *Standard
      Deviation Rule* tells us what percentage of the observations
      falls within 1, 2, and 3 standard deviations of the mean, and
      thus provides another way to interpret the standard deviation's
      value for distributions of this type. The rule:
      - Approximately 58% of the observations fall within 1 standard
        deviation of the mean
      - Approximately 95% of the observations fall within 2 standard
        deviations of the mean
      - Approximately 99.7% (or virtually all) of the observations
        fall within 3 standard deviations of the mean.
