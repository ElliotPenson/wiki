#+TITLE: Amazon EC2
#+AUTHOR: Elliot Penson

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides
resizable compute capacity in the cloud. Amazon EC2 reduces the time required to
obtain and boot new server instances to minutes, allowing you to quickly scale
capacity, both up and down, as your computing requirements change. EC2 is
effectively virtual machines in the cloud.

Amazon EC2 changes the economics of computing by allowing you to pay only for
capacity that you actually use. Amazon EC2 provides developers the tools to
build failure resilient applications and isolate themselves from common failure
scenarios.

See the [[https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/faqs/][EC2 FAQs]] for more information.

* Pricing Options

** On Demand

   Pay a fixed rate by the hour (or by the second) with no commitment.
   
   Use Cases:
   - Applications with short term, spiky, or unpredictable workloads that cannot
     be interrupted.
   - Applications that are being developed or tested on Amazon EC2 for the first
     time.
   - Users that want the low cost and flexibility of Amazon EC2 without any
     up-front payment or long-term commitment.

** Reserved

   Provides you with a capacity reservation, and offers a significant discount
   on the hourly charge for an instance. 1 year or 3 year terms.

   Use cases:
  - Applications with a steady state or predictable usage.
  - Applications that require reserved capacity.
  - Users are able to make upfront payments to reduce their total computing
    costs even further.

** Spot

   Enables you to bid whatever price you want for instance capacity, providing
   for even greater savings if your applications have flexible start and end
   times. Once the price goes below your bid, your instance will start up.

   Use cases:
   - Applications that have flexible start and end times.
   - Applications that are only feasible at very low compute prices. Example
     usage might be big data processing that can happen at 3AM.
   - Users with urgent computing needs for large amounts of additional capacity.

   *Note*: with spot instances, if you terminate the instance, you pay for the
   hour. If AWS terminates the spot instance, you get the hour it was terminated
   in for free.

** Dedicated Hosts

   Physical EC2 server /dedicated/ for your use. This in contrast to the other
   types which are /shared/. Dedicated Hosts can help you reduce costs by
   allowing you to use your existing server-bound software licenses. Can be
   purchased on-demand (hourly). Can also be purchased as a reservation for up
   to 70% off the on-demand price.

   Use cases:
   - Useful for regulatory requirements that may not support multi-tenant
     virtualization.
   - Great for licensing which does not support multi-tenancy or cloud
     deployments.

* Amazon Machine Image (AMI)

  When first creating an EC2 instance you get to choose an Amazon Machine Image
  (AMI). An AMI is a virtual appliance. The main component is a read-only
  filesystem image that includes an operating system and any additional
  software. You can create AMIs from both Volumes and Snapshots.

  If you set up an instance, take a snapshot, and then create an AMI, you can
  use that AMI to launch a new instance that has the same setup. This template
  can ease future set ups.

** AMI Types

   You can select your AMI based on: region, operating system, architecture
   (32-bit or 64-bit), launch permissions, storage for the root device (root
   device volume).

   All AMIs are categorized as either backed by /Amazon EBS/ or backed by
   /Instance Store/. For EBS Volumes, the root device for an instance launched
   form the AMI is an Amazon EBS volume created from an Amazon EBS snapshot. For
   Instance Store Volumes, the root device for an instance launched from the AMI
   is an instance store volume created from a template stored in Amazon S3.

   Instance Store Volumes are sometimes called Ephemeral Storage. Instance Store
   Volumes cannot be stopped. If the underlying host fails, you will lose your
   data. EBS backed instances can be stopped. You will not lose the data on this
   instance if it is stopped. You can reboot both, you will not lost your
   data. By default, both ROOT volumes will be deleted on termination, however
   with EBS volumes, you can tell AWS to keep the root device volume.

* Termination

  /Terminating/ an instance shuts it down and deletes it. On an EBS-backed
  instance, the default action is for the root EBS volume to be deleted when the
  instance is terminated.

  *Termination Protection* can be set on EC2 instances to prevent termination
  until the option is disabled.

* Encryption

  EBS volumes may be encrypted. However, EBS Root Volumes of your DEFAULT AMIs
  cannot be encrypted. You can also use a third party tool (such as bit locker
  etc) to encrypt the root volume, or this can be done when creating AMIs in the
  AWS console or using the API. Of course, additional volumes can be encrypted.

* Instance Lifecycle

* Security Groups

  A Security Group is a virtual firewall. It's a set of rules that control the
  traffic to and from your instance.

  You can have any number of EC2 instances within a Security Group. You can
  also have multiple Security Groups attached to EC2 instances.

  Changes to Security Groups take effect immediately.

** Rules
   
   Security Group rules are a whitelist; you can specify allow rules, but not
   deny rules. This means that you cannot block specific IP addresses using
   Security Groups (for this purpose use Network Access Control Lists).

   Rules can be *inbound* or *outbound*. Rules are *stateful*; If you create an
   inbound rule allowing traffic in, that traffic is automatically allowed back
   out again.

** Defaults

   All inbound traffic is blocked by default. All outbound traffic is allowed by
   default.

* SSH

  You can ~ssh~ into an EC2 instance with

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    ssh ec2-user@<public-ip> -i keyPair.pem
  #+END_SRC

* Load Balancing

  Load balancers distribute the workload across multiple computing
  resources. AWS provides *Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)* for load balancing EC2
  instances. Instances monitored ELB are reported as /InService/ or
  /OutofService/. Once your EC2 instance is out of service, traffic won't be
  sent there. /Health Checks/ check the instance by talking to it (usually HTTP
  or HTTPS).

  Elastic Load Balancers have their own DNS name. Unlike EC2, you don't get a
  public IP address for you load balancer. AWS manages the IP behind the scenes.

  AWS provides an /Application Load Balancer/ and /Classic Load Balancer/. See
  the ELB FAQ for more information.

* AIM Roles and EC2
  
  Manually setting credentials with ~aws configure~ can be a security risk on
  EC2 instances. If an EC2 instance is compromised, these credentials can be
  stolen. In addition, setting credentials in this way can be difficult to
  manage. Roles can improve security and ease management. Create a role using
  IAM. Roles can be attached to EC2 instances when they are created or even when
  they are running.

* Bootstrap Scripts

  When you launch an instance in Amazon EC2, you can choose to run /user
  data/. This may be a shell script. Specify a script under /Advanced Details/
  during the launch wizard. Use a shebang (~#!~) at the start of the script. You
  can see the contents of user data with ~curl
  http://169.254.169.254/latest/user-data/~.

* Metadata

  Retrieve metadata about your current EC2 instance with ~curl
  http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/~. This will give a list of
  variables. To get the public IP address, run ~curl
  http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/public-ipv4~.

* Auto Scaling

  An /Auto Scaling group/ contains a collection of EC2 instances that share
  similar characteristics and are treated as a logical group for the purposes of
  instance scaling and management. For example, if a single application operates
  across multiple instances, you might want to increase the number of instances
  in that group to improve the performance of the application, or decrease the
  number of instances to reduce costs when demand is low. You can use the Auto
  Scaling group to scale the number of instances automatically based on criteria
  that you specify, or maintain a fixed number of instances even if an instance
  becomes unhealthy.

  Create an Auto Scaling group through the EC2 page on the AWS console. First
  you'll need to create a launch configuration. Creating this template looks
  very similar to a normal EC2 launch. Next, create an Auto Scaling
  group. Specify how many instances you want to run in the group. Your group
  will maintain this number of instances, and replace any that become unhealthy
  or impaired. You can optionally configure your group to adjust in capacity
  according to demand, in response to Amazon CloudWatch metrics.

* Placement Group

  A /Placement Group/ is a logical grouping of instances within a single
  Availability Zone. Using placement groups enables applications to participate
  in a low-latency, 10 Gbps network. Placement groups are recommended for
  applications that benefit from low network latency, high network throughput,
  or both.

  - A placement group can't span multiple Availability Zones (make sense, we're
    looking for high network speed).
  - The name you specify for a placement group must be unique within your AWS
    account.
  - Only certain types of instances can be launched in a placement group
    (Compute Optimized, GPU, Memory Optimized, Storage Optimized).
  - AWS recommend homogenous instances within placement groups.
  - You can't merge placement groups.
  - You can't move an existing instance into a placement group. You can create
    an AMI from your existing instance, and then launch a new instance from the
    AMI into a placement group.
