#+TITLE: Dynamic Programming
#+AUTHOR: Elliot Penson

Dynamic programming is a technique for efficiently implementing a recursive
algorithm by storing partial results. Dynamic programming guarantees
/correctness/ by searching all possibilities and provides /efficiency/ by
storing results to avoid recomputing. If the naive recursive algorithm computes
the same subproblems over and over again, storing the answer for each subproblem
in a table to look up instead of recompute can lead to an efficient
algorithm. Dynamic programming is essentially a tradeoff of space for time.

* Fibonacci Example

  Let's look at a simple program for computing the nth Fibonacci number.

  #+BEGIN_SRC python
    def fib(n):
        if n == 0:
            return 0
        if n == 1:
            return 1
        return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)
  #+END_SRC

  The course of execution for this recursive algorithm is illustrated by its
  *recursion tree*.

  Note that $F(4)$ is computed on both sides of the recursion tree, and $F(2)$
  is computed no less than five times in this small example. This redundancy
  drastically affects performance.

  We can improve performance by storing (or *caching*) the results of each
  Fibonacci computation $F(k)$ indexed by the parameter $k$.

  #+BEGIN_SRC python
    cache = {0: 0, 1: 1}
    def fib(n):
        if n not in cache:
            cache[n] = fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)
        return cache[n]
  #+END_SRC

  This approach is a simple way to get /most/ of the benefits of full dynamic
  programming. Here's the recursion tree:

  [[file:../images/fib-caching.png]]

  Let's go a step further with full dynamic programming! We can calculate
  $F(n)$ in linear time and space with no recursive calls by explicitly
  specifying the order of evaluation of the recurrence relation.

  #+BEGIN_SRC python
    def fib(n):
        f = [0, 1]
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            f.append(f[i - 1] + f[i - 2])
        return f[n]
  #+END_SRC

  However, more careful study shows that we do not need to store all the
  intermediate values for the entire period of execution.

  #+BEGIN_SRC python
    def fib(n):
        if n == 0:
            return 0

        back_2, back_1 = 0, 1
        for _ in range(2, n):
            back_2, back_1 = back_1, back_1 + back_2
        return back_1 + back_2
  #+END_SRC

  This analysis reduces the storage demands to constant space with no
  asymptotic degradation in running time.

* Approximate String Matching

  To deal with inexact string matching, we must first define a cost function
  telling us how far apart two strings are - i.e., a distance measure between
  pairs of strings. *Edit distance* reflects the number of /changes/ that must
  be made to convert one string to another. There are three natural types of
  changes: /substitution/, /insertion/, and /deletion/. Edit distance assigns
  each operation an equal cost of 1. Here's a recursive edit distance function:

  #+BEGIN_SRC python
     def edit_distance(source, target):
         if not source:
             return len(target)
         if not target:
             return len(source)

         substitution_cost = 0 if source[-1] == target[-1] else 1
         return min(edit_distance(source[:-1], target[:-1]) + substitution_cost,
                    edit_distance(source, target[:-1]) + 1,  # insertion
                    edit_distance(source[:-1], target) + 1)  # deletion
  #+END_SRC

  This program is absolutely correct but impossible slow. A table-based,
  dynamic programming implementation of this algorithm is given below. ~costs~
  is a two-dimensional matrix where each cell contains the optimal solution to
  a subproblem (i.e. ~costs[x][y]~ is ~edit_distance(source[:x],
  target[:y])~).

  #+BEGIN_SRC python
     def edit_distance(source, target):
         costs = [[None for _ in range(len(target) + 1)]
                  for _ in range(len(source) + 1)]

         for index in range(len(costs)):
             costs[index][0] = index
         for index in range(len(costs[0])):
             costs[0][index] = index

         for x in range(1, len(source) + 1):
             for y in range(1, len(target) + 1):
                 substitution_cost = 0 if source[x - 1] == target[y - 1] else 1
                 costs[x][y] = min(costs[x - 1][y - 1] + substitution_cost,
                                   costs[x - 1][y] + 1,  # insertion
                                   costs[x][y - 1] + 1)  # deletion
         return costs[-1][-1]
  #+END_SRC

  The first row and the first column represent the empty prefix of the source
  and target, respectively. This is why the matrix height/width is larger than
  the source/target length.

  Note that it is unnecessary to store the entire ~O(mn)~ matrix. The
  recurrence only requires two rows at a time. Thus, this algorithm could be
  further optimized to ~O(n)~ space without changing the time complexity.

* Dynamic Programming in Practice

  There are three steps involved in solving a problem by dynamic programming:

  1. Formulate the answer as a recurrence relation or recursive algorithm.
  2. Show that the number of different parameter values taken on by your
     recurrence is bounded by a (hopefully small) polynomial.
  3. Specify an order of evaluation for the recurrence so the partial results
     you need are always available when you need them.

  In practice, you'll find that dynamic programming algorithms are usually
  easier to work out from scratch than look up.

* The Partition Problem

  Suppose three workers are given the task of scanning through a shelf of books
  in search of a given piece of information. To get the job done fairly and
  efficiently, the books are to be partitioned among the three workers. If the
  books are the same length, the job is easy: ~100 100 100 | 100 100 100 | 100
  100 100~. If the books are not the same length, the task becomes more
  difficult (~100 200 300 400 500 | 600 700 | 800 900~). An algorithm that
  solves this *linear partition problem* takes as input an arrangement $S$ of
  nonnegative numbers and an integer $k$. The algorithm should partition $S$
  into $k$ or fewer ranges, to minimize the maximum sum over all ranges,
  without reordering any of the numbers.

  A heuristic to solve this problem might compute the average size of a
  partition and then try and insert dividers to come close to this
  average. Unfortunately, this method is doomed to fail on certain inputs.

  Instead, consider a recursive, exhaustive search approach to solving this
  problem. The /k/th partition starts right after we placed the (k - 1)st
  divider. Where can we place this last ((k - 1)st) divider? Between the ith and
  (i + 1)st elements for some $i$, where $1 \leq i \leq n$. What is the cost of
  this? The total cost will be the larger of two qualtities - (1) the cost of
  the last partition and (2) the cost of the largest partition formed to the
  left of $i$. What is the size of this left partition? To minimize our total,
  we want to use the $k - 2$ remaining dividers to partition the elements
  $\{s_1, ..., s_i\}$ as equally as possible. This is a smaller instance of the
  same problem and hence can be solved recursively!

  Therefore, let us define $M[n, k]$ to be the minimum possible cost over all
  partitions of $\{s_1, ..., s_n\}$ into $k$ ranges, where the cost of a
  partition is the largest sum of elements in one of its parts. Thus defined,
  this function cab be evaluated:

  \begin{equation}
  M[n,k] = min(i=1, n)(max(M[i, k - 1], \sum_{j = i + 1}^{n} s_j))
  \end{equation}

  This recurrence can be solved with dynamic programming in $O(kn^2)$
  time. Note that we also need a second matrix, $D$ to reconstruct the optimal
  partition. Whenever we update the value of $M[i, j]$, we record which divider
  position was required to achieve that value.
