* Overview

  A tree is an acyclic, connected graph. In other words, any two vertices are
  connected by /exactly/ one path. Conventional tree operations are /insert/,
  /search/, /remove/, and /traverse/.

  - The *root* indicates the top of the tree.
  - *Leaves* refer to nodes with no children.
  - A *parent* is the node above the current one. A *child* is the node below
    the current one.
  - A node is an *ancestor* of /d/ if it lies on the search path from the root
    to /d/. If a node is an ancestor of /d/, we say /d/ is a *descendant* of
    that node.
  - A tree is *balanced* when every path from root to leaf has the same length.

* Binary Search Tree

  [[file:../images/binary-tree.png]]
  
  A *binary tree* is recursively defined as being empty or consisting of a root
  node with left and right subtrees. A *binary /search/ tree* (BST) labels each
  node in a binary tree with a single key such that for any node labeled $x$,
  all nodes in the left subtree have $keys < x$ while all nodes in the right
  subtree have $keys > x$.

  - ∀ y ∈ left subtree of x, y ≤ x
  - ∀ y ∈ right subtree of x, y ≥ x

  Binary tree nodes have left and right pointer fields, an optional parent
  pointer, and a data field.

** Traversal

   Traversal involves visiting all nodes. *In-order* traversal of a binary
   search tree can be done recursively with the following.

   #+BEGIN_SRC python
     def traverse(tree):
         if tree:
             traverse(tree.left)
             process(tree.item)
             traverse(tree.right)
   #+END_SRC

   Changing the position of ~process~ gives alternate traversal
   orders. Processing the item first yields a *pre-order* traversal, while
   processing it last gives a *post-order* traversal.

** Performance

   /Search/, /insert/, and /delete/ all take $O(h)$ time, where $h$ is the
   height of the tree. A perfectly balanced tree has $h = \lceil \log n
   \rceil$. Unfortunately, inserting keys in sorted order produces a skinny
   linear height tree, $h = n$. Randomizing insert order will produce $O(\log
   n)$ height on average.

   | Operation | Best Complexity | Worst Complexity |
   |-----------+-----------------+------------------|
   | Insert    | $O(\log n)$     | $O(n)$           |
   | Search    | $O(\log n)$     | $O(n)$           |
   | Delete    | $O(\log n)$     | $O(n)$           |

   A binary search tree is *complete* if every node has zero or two
   children and all leaves are at the same level.

** Balanced Search Trees

   *Balanced binary search tree* data structures adjust the tree during
   insertion/delete to guarantee that height will always be $O(\log
   n)$. Balanced tree implementations include *red-black trees* and *splay
   trees*.
